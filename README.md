# react-posts

react-posts is a SPA that fetches posts and comments from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and displays them

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install dependencies after cloning the repository and navigating to react-posts in your local machine.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Use the below command to spawn a local dev server and run the app.

```bash
npm run dev-server
```

## Improvements

- Possibly consider a load more button that only loads say for instance 20 items at a time, this would be for cases when the api returns a millions of results
- UI improvements : Addition of animated loader
